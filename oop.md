## What are the fundamentals of oop concepts
1. Encapsulation
   When an object's internal representation is hidden from view outside it's definition, it is said to be encapsulated. Only the necessary information is accessible, while the rest of the data implementation is hidden.
2. Abstraction
   Abstraction is the process of identifying and eliminating irrelevant details from an object's critical behavior and data.
3. Inheritance
   Inheritance is the ability to create new classes from existing ones. It is accomplished by gaining access to, altering, and extending the behavior of objects in the parent class.
4. Polymorphism
   Polymorphism is a name that means "one name, many forms." It is accomplished using several methods with the same name but different implementations.
